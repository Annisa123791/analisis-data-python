# Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics
This is a final project from Dicoding in the "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course to make analysis and create a dashboard from the bike sharing dataset. In the notebook file, I attached the way I did the analysis from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. 

## Setup environment
```
pip install pandas 
pip install seaborn
pip install matplotlib
pip install streamlit
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Run steamlit app
```
cd dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
